# say-hi-to-traffic-signals

## Goal

The final goal of this project is to make an Android app that provides signal change countdown information of passenger traffic signals near the user.

## Suspension

Korean government of traffic doesn't provides signal data or related API for passenger signals. I can't wander around everywhere collecting signal data, so the project is going to be suspended for uncertain time.

## Language

The only contributor of this project is Korean. Sorry about poor English, but you can still contact with me in basic English.
